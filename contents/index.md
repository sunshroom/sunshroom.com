Welcome to my personal web presence! I am Alexander Synaptic, a [designer](/design), [developer](/development), [photographer](/photography), and [writer](/writing), among other things.

I am currently hard at work bootstrapping my startup in Taipei. I love to travel, particularly by bicycle, and follow a minimalist location-independent lifestyle. I support free culture, open source software, and the Creative Commons. Read more about me in [my biography](/biography).

I created this web site to showcase some of my major projects and to provide an easy way for people to find me on the web. [I welcome email correspondence](/contact) from friends and strangers!
