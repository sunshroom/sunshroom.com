> Welcome to the personal web presence of Alexander Synaptic!

I am a generalist: a designer, developer, entrepreneur, photographer, DJ, label owner, scientist, writer, and more. I love to travel, enjoy a minimalist lifestyle, and support free culture, open source software, and the Creative Commons. Read more about me in [my biography](/biography).

I created this web site to showcase some of my major projects and provide an easy way for people to find me on the web. [I welcome email correspondence](/contact) from friends and strangers.
