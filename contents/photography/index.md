<img src="synaptic-ideal.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Capturing the world I see." alt="Capturing the world I see." /> My insatiable curiosity and perpetual wanderlust compel me to explore this strange and fantastical world of ours in a deep and incisive way. With [my photography](http://synapticimagery.com) I aim to share my adventures filtered through the lens of memory, as surreal and dreamlike imagery infused with a sense of [magic realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism).

I am endlessly fascinated by the secret lives of inanimate objects, the eerie solemnity of abandoned places, the desolate beauty of [manufactured landscapes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832903/), and the wonders of remote and exotic locales. I am drawn to the visual rhythm of grit, grime, and decay and inspired by the majestic works of nature. I am especially interested in the juxtaposition and intersection of organic and artificial forms, particularly those places where nature is busily reclaiming manmade structures and objects. Most of all I am intent on exposing the hidden stories and forgotten fables all around us.

My work can be broadly categorized into nature, landscape, travel, street, and urban exploration (urbex) photography, but I am also interested in capturing people, textures, and abstract imagery.

I am also a [graphic designer](/design) and use a lot of my own original photography in my work.

## <a name="equipment"></a>Equipment

I mainly shoot with a Nikon D3100 (formerly a D40) and the kit lens (18-55mm). I have explored using accessories such as a tripod and a bounce flash but always return to a minimal setup for ease of use and portability.

## <a name="processing"></a>Processing

I make extensive use of Adobe Lightroom in my post-processing workflow. All of my development presets are open source and available for download via [GitHub](https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets). The collection is constantly evolving as I learn more about the software and experiment with new techniques.
