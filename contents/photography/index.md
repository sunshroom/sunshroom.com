With [my photography](http://synapticism.com/c/portfolio/photography/) I wish to share my explorations of this strange and fantastical world of ours.

I am endlessly fascinated by the secret lives of inanimate objects, the eerie solemnity of abandoned places, and the desolate beauty of [manufactured landscapes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832903/). I am drawn to the visual rhythm of grit, grime, and decay.

I intend to let others see the world through my eyes, not just my camera lens. I digitally alter my photographs to better reflect my experience of reality---as a strange and fantastical realm riddled with hidden stories and long-lost secrets. With my overly active imagination much of what I do can be considered [magic realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism).

I am also a [graphic designer](/design/) and use a lot of my own original photography in my work.

## Equipment

I mainly shoot with a Nikon D3100 (formerly a D40) and the kit lens (18--55mm). I have explored using accessories such as a tripod and a bounce flash but always return to a minimal setup for ease of use and portability.

## Processing

I make extensive use of Adobe Lightroom in my post-processing workflow. All of my development presets are open source and available for download via [GitHub](https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets). The collection is constantly evolving as I learn more about the software and experiment with new techniques.
