I am a self-taught designer with more than 15 years of experience in front-end development, user interface design, and the graphic arts.

While on leave from the IT world I completed more than 50 album covers, most of which were produced for [my own record label](http://www.ektoplazm.com). The vast majority of these projects feature a "maximal" approach to design, often integrating [my own original photography](/photography/).

### Album artwork examples

Still to come.
