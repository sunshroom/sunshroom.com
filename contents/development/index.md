I have been developing web sites since the late 1990s but only recently got serious about programming. Nowadays I am learning JavaScript, Node, and Angular with the goal of becoming a full stack developer.

Prior to this I worked as a front-end developer and user interface designer from 1999 to 2007. I mainly worked with HTML, CSS, and various templating languages and seldom made any forays into server-side programming.

In the middle of the noughties I discovered WordPress and began to teach myself PHP and MySQL on my own time. With my newfound skills I built a niche market music distribution platform, described below. I left the corporate world for higher education but continued to work on my own projects, learning new skills as I went along, particularly when scaling my web site with Nginx.

After graduating from university in 2011 my interst in web technology was rekindled and I began the long process of updating my skills and workflow for the new decade.

## Projects

Here are several projects I have worked on over the course of the last few years.

### Ektoplazm

My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, [Ektoplazm](http://www.ektoplazm.com), which became very popular in the subculture it serves. Since 2007 more than 10 million full releases have been downloaded--approximately 50 million tracks in all, a number on par with industry giants like Bandcamp. This was accomplished on a shoestring budget without any advertising dollars. The full story is covered on my blog in [a beginner's guide to Ektoplazm](http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/).

These days I am deeply engaged in redeveloping the site after completing [a successful crowdfunding campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/ektoplazm-2012) in the summer of 2012.

### My homepage

[This homepage](http://alexandersynaptic.com) is an experiment in using Wintersmith, a Node-based static site generator, to create a simple personal homepage. The best way to learn is to give yourself a project--so I took it upon myself to learn how to work with Node, Jade, Stylus, Grunt, Bower, and GitHub pages by developing this site. [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/synapticism/alexandersynaptic.com).

### Nginx configuration files

While scaling Ektoplazm I switched from Apache to Nginx and went rather deep into configuration file hackery. [Here is my personal library](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config) of configuration files used to manage multiple domains on Dreamhost with a special focus on serving large media objects.
