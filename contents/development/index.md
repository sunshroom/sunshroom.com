I have been developing web sites since the late 1990s but only recently got serious about programming. Nowadays I am learning JavaScript, Node, and Angular with the lofty goal of becoming a full stack developer.

Prior to this I worked as a front-end developer and user interface designer from 1999 to 2007. I primarily worked with HTML, CSS, and various templating languages, seldom making any forays into server-side programming.

In the middle of the 2000s I discovered [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and began to teach myself PHP and MySQL on my own time. With my newfound skills I built a niche market [music distribution platform](#ektoplazm). I left the corporate world for higher education but continued to work on my own projects, learning new skills as I went along, particularly when scaling my web site with [Nginx](#nginx).

After [graduating from university in 2011](/biography#education) my interest in web technology was rekindled and I began the long process of updating my skills and workflow for the new decade.

## Projects

Here are several development projects I have worked on over the course of the last few years.

### <a name="ektoplazm"></a>Ektoplazm

My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, [Ektoplazm](http://www.ektoplazm.com), which became very popular in the subculture it serves. Between 2007 and 2013 more than 10 million full releases were downloaded--approximately 50 million tracks in all, a number on par with industry giants like Bandcamp. This was accomplished on a shoestring budget without any advertising dollars. The full story is covered on my blog in [a beginner's guide to Ektoplazm](http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/).

These days I am deeply engaged in redeveloping the site after completing [a successful crowdfunding campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/ektoplazm-2012) in the summer of 2012.

### <a name="homepage"></a>My homepage

[This homepage](http://alexandersynaptic.com) is an experiment in using Wintersmith, a Node-based static site generator, to create a simple personal homepage. The best way to learn is to give yourself a project--so I took it upon myself to learn how to work with Node, Jade, Stylus, Grunt, Bower, and GitHub Pages to develop this web site. [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/synapticism/alexandersynaptic.com).

### <a name="nginx"></a>Nginx configuration files

While scaling Ektoplazm I switched from Apache to Nginx and went rather deep into configuration file hackery. [Here is my personal library](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config) of configuration files used to manage multiple domains on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) with an emphasis on serving large media objects.
