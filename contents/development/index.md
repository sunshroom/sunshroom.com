My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, [Ektoplazm](http://www.ektoplazm.com), which surpassed 1.5 million unique visitors in 2011 and has served more than 10 million full releases (roughly 50 million tracks), all on a shoestring budget without any advertising. I am presently engaged in redeveloping the site after completing a successful crowdfunding campaign in the summer of 2012.

Past proficiencies: WordPress, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Nginx, etc. Anything I donâ€™t know I tend to pick up fairly quickly.

These days I am focused on learning JavaScript and Node. My goal is to become a full stack developer.
