I have been developing web sites since the late 1990s but only recently got serious about programming. Nowadays I am learning JavaScript, Node, and Angular to expand my capabilities while continuing to work intensively with WordPress.

Prior to this I worked as a front-end developer and user interface designer from 1999 to 2007. I primarily worked with HTML, CSS, and various templating languages, seldom making any forays into server-side programming.

In the middle of the 2000s I discovered [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and began to teach myself PHP and MySQL on my own time. With my newfound skills I built a niche market [music distribution platform](#ektoplazm). I left the corporate world for higher education but continued to work on my own projects, learning new skills as I went along, particularly when scaling my web site with [Nginx](#nginx).

After [graduating from university in 2011](/biography#education) my interest in web technology was rekindled and I began updating my skills and workflow for the new decade.

## Projects

Here are several development projects I have worked on over the course of the last few years.

### <a name="ektoplazm"></a>Ektoplazm

My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, [Ektoplazm](http://www.ektoplazm.com), which became very popular in the subculture it serves. Between 2007 and 2013 more than 10 million full releases were downloaded--approximately 50 million tracks in all, a number on par with industry giants like Bandcamp. This was accomplished on a shoestring budget without any advertising dollars. The full story is covered on my blog in [a beginner's guide to Ektoplazm](http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/).

These days I am deeply engaged in redeveloping the site after completing [a successful crowdfunding campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/ektoplazm-2012) in the summer of 2012.

### <a name="pendrell"></a>Pendrell

[Pendrell](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell) is a minimalistic yet fully-featured WordPress theme meant for personal blogging and lifestreaming. You can see it in action on my blog, [Synapticism](http://synapticism.com). I have also adapted Pendrell for use on the [Drumlore](http://drumlore.com) and [Omnitropic](http://omnitropic.com) web sites.

### <a name="ubik"></a>Ubik

[Ubik](https://github.com/synapticism/ubik) is a handy set of tools for WordPress bundled as a plugin. It works behind the scenes to improve SEO, enrich content with semantic HTML5 markup, reduce bloat, and generally sharpen the end-user experience. Ubik also includes lightweight implementations of common custom taxonomies including post series and places.

### <a name="homepage"></a>My homepage

[This homepage](http://alexandersynaptic.com) is an experiment in using Wintersmith, a Node-based static site generator, to create a simple personal nameplate site. The best way to learn is to give yourself a project--so I took it upon myself to learn how to work with Node, Jade, Stylus, Grunt, Bower, and GitHub Pages to develop this web site. [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/synapticism/alexandersynaptic.com).

### <a name="nginx"></a>Nginx

While scaling Ektoplazm I switched from Apache to Nginx and went rather deep into configuration file hackery. [Here is my personal library](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config) of configuration files used to manage multiple domains on [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) with an emphasis on serving large media objects.

## Skills

* HTML5, CSS3 (with Sass/SCSS), JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
* WordPress development: [theme](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell) and [plugin](https://github.com/synapticism/ubik) authoring, [configuration](https://github.com/synapticism/wp-config-x), performance tuning, and search engine optimization.
* [Nginx configuration](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config) and optimization; a pinch of Apache as needed.
* [Gulp](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell/blob/master/gulpfile.js) and Grunt-based build processes.
* Content management, online promotion, copywriting, social media, and that sort of thing. I know how to get things done.
* Graphic design in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom.
* Scientific research, statistics, mapping, and so on.
* Node.js and Angular (learning).

## For hire

I am open to Node and WordPress-based freelance work. Please [contact me](/connect) to discuss the details of your project. *Serious inquiries only!*
