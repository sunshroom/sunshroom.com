I have been passionate about music for as long as I can remember. Over the years this has driven me to apply myself to various music-related projects. I never seem to get around to creating music myself--but I certainly facilitate its production and consumption through DJing, operating several record labes, and managing my free music distribution portal.

## Record labels

### Ektoplazm

Ektoplazm is the name of my music distribution portal as well as my first netlabel. Founded in 2008, the Ektoplazm record label is chartered to promote unconventional talent with a professional approach to releasing free music in MP3, FLAC, and WAV format. The label has no defining sound; instead, it is dedicated to showcasing the range and diversity of the global psychedelic trance movement, always with an ear for quality.

### Omnitropic

Omnitropic is Ektoplazm's downtempo and ambient sublabel. Founded in 2009, this label is dedicated to releasing a wide range of high-quality downtempo, ambient, psychedelic dub, and experimental soundscapes.

### Drumlore

Drumlore was originally founded in 2009 as an experiment in using free music to promote real-world events. Every release in the original Drumlore series was designed to promote a party featuring the artist on that same release. These releases were put out about a month in advance of each event, all of which were held in Toronto and generally well-attended. I also took a different approach with the album artwork in the original series; each piece was produced during a "one hour design challenge".
