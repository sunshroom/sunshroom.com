<img src="../biography/synaptic-tunnel-vision.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Tunnel vision." alt="Tunnel vision." /> **The best way to reach me is to email me at [alexander@synapticism.com](mailto:alexander@synapticism.com).**

My primary personal web presence is here at [alexandersynaptic.com](http://alexandersynaptic.com). I have created this site to provide a broad level overview of who I am and what I do.

I also blog and maintain [design](http://synapticism.com/c/design), [development](http://synapticism.com/c/development), and [photography](http://synapticism.com/c/photography) portfolios at [Synapticism](http://synapticism.com).

In 2014 I opened [Synaptic Imagery](http://synapticimagery.com), a professional photography portfolio. Check it out to see some of my best work.

Beyond that you can find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/synaptic), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/synapticism), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/synapticism), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/synapticx), and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Synapticism).
