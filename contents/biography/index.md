<img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology.

I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate domains.

## Travel

I love to travel but started later in life than many people do. I was too committed to the idea of settling down, saving money, and eventually getting married to brashly give up my job and cavort around the world. In those years of solemn responsibility I took two short trips to Mexico and one trip to Belgium and Holland. After graduation I felt much less restrained and began an ongoing exploration of the far east. Since 2012 I have been to Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia, and Thailand. Nowadays I live in Taiwan.
