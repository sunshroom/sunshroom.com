<img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology. I am, by nature, a generalist, and expect to continually evolve long into the future.

I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned.

## Travel

I love to travel but started later in life than many people do. I was too committed to the idea of settling down, saving money, and eventually getting married to brashly give up my job and cavort around the world. In those years of solemn responsibility I took two short trips to Mexico and one trip to Belgium and Holland. After graduation I felt much less restrained and began an ongoing exploration of the far east. Since 2012 I have been to Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia, and Thailand. Nowadays I live in Taiwan.

Read about some of my travels on my personal blog:

- [A 27 day bicycle trip around Taiwan](http://synapticism.com/series/taiwan-bicycle-tour-2013/).
- [One week in Seoul](http://synapticism.com/series/south-korea-2012/).
- [Five days in Hong Kong](http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/).

I have no formal qualifications with graphic arts or development but I hold a B.Sc. with honours from the University of Toronto where I double majored in ecology/evolutionary biology and physical/environmental geography. Nowadays I am back on the development and design path, a strange twist after five years in the classroom and laboratory, but it feels right. 2013 is an exciting time to be involved in web technology!
