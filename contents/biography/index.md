Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology. I am, by nature, a generalist, a jack-of-all-trades (and master of at least a few), a dilettante more than a cognoscenti in most of what I do—though I’m not particularly ashamed of this fact. I’ve spent a great deal of my life dedicated to electronic music culture, information technology, and life science. I have no formal qualifications with graphic arts or computers but I hold a B.Sc. with honours from the University of Toronto where I double majored in ecology/evolutionary biology and physical/environmental geography. Nowadays I am back on the development and design path, a strange twist after five years in the classroom and laboratory, but it feels right. 2013 is an exciting time to be involved in web technology!

## Development

I describe my development philosophy as “getting things done”. Although I am not a hardcore coder I still manage to pull together some awesome projects. My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, Ektoplazm, which has eclipsed 1.5 million unique visitors in 2011 and has served more than 8 million full releases (roughly 35 million tracks), all on a shoestring budget without any advertising. I am presently engaged in redeveloping the site after completing a successful crowdfunding campaign in the summer of 2012.

My proficiencies: WordPress, HTML5, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Nginx, etc. Anything I don’t know I tend to pick up fairly quickly.

## Design

I am a self-taught designer with more than 15 years of experience with an emphasis on front-end development, user interface design, and the graphic arts. A few years ago I dropped out of the IT industry to pursue a hard science degree (see above). Since then I have worked mainly on my own personal projects, none of which are particularly clean or corporate, but returned to design for business purposes in late 2011 and I am sure these skills will come in handy.

While on leave from the IT world I completed in excess of 50 album covers, most of which were produced for my own record label. The vast majority of these projects feature a “maximal” approach to design, but I am becoming a devout minimalist as time wears on. Much of my work is based on my own original photography, prepared in Lightroom and imported into Photoshop for layout and typesetting.

## Photography

Photography is a way for me to share my view of the world with others. I shoot with a Nikon D3100 (formerly a D40) and the kit lens (18-55mm) most of the time. I have not invested heavily in equipment, preferring instead to make the most of a minimal setup and expressive post-processing in Adobe Lightroom.

In terms of subject matter, I have a strong appreciation for texture, grit, grime, and decay. I explore industrial lands, trainyards, and laneways to expose the underbelly of civilization. I enjoy the juxtaposition of organic and artificial forms, particularly in areas where nature is in the process of reclaiming man-made structures or environments. I want to reveal the secret lives of inanimate objects and tell cryptic stories of forgotten places. I wish to uncover the subtle beauty hidden within ugly scenes of devastation and neglect.
