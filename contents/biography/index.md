<img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology.

I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate domains.

I am currently bootstrapping my "accidental" startup in Taipei, Taiwan. During university my music blog became quite popular so I started a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was support to transform it into something more. There was! And now I am deeply engaged in realizing my vision of a different kind of independent music distribution platform. Moving to Taiwan is part of the plan--here I can be productive without burning through a lot of money. It is also an extraordinary adventure living the expat lifestyle in this beautiful foreign land!

I earned a Bachelor of Science with honours from the University of Toronto, Woodsworth College, 2007-2011. I double-majored in two split programs, making my degree quite the tongue-twister: ecology/evolutionary biology and physical/environmental geography. I was on the dean's list every year and won numerous scholarships and awards including the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award in 2009. I worked on two major research projects in the paleoclimate laboratory and got to know my way around the raw material scientists use to reconstruct past environments from biological proxy data.
