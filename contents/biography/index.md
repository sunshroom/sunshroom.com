<img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> I am **Alexander Synaptic**, a [designer](/design), [developer](/development), and [photographer](/photography), among other things. I also work with [music](/music) as a DJ, record label owner, and distributor. I am currently bootstrapping [my "accidental" startup](#entrepreneurship) in Taipei, Taiwan.

Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology. I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate domains.

I love to [travel](#travel), especially by bicycle, and follow a [minimalist](#minimalism) lifestyle. I support [free culture](#free), open source software, and the Creative Commons. I studied evolutionary biology and physical geography in [university](#education).



## <a name="entrepreneurship"></a>Entrepreneurship

I am currently bootstrapping my "accidental" startup in Taipei, Taiwan. During university [my music blog](/development) became quite popular so I started a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was support to transform it into something more. There was! And now I am deeply engaged in realizing my vision of a forward-thinking independent music distribution platform. Moving to Taiwan is part of the plan--here I can be productive without burning through a lot of money. It is also an extraordinary adventure living the expat lifestyle in this beautiful foreign land.



## <a name="travel"></a>Travel

I have always wanted to the world but didn't act on that dream until [graduating from university](#education) in 2011. In 2012 I visited Asia for the first time, landing in [Hong Kong](http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/) for a brief visit before moving on to Thailand for two troubled months and [one week in Seoul](http://synapticism.com/series/south-korea-2012/) on the way home. This trip changed me; I became restless with wanderlust and soon returned to Asia for another round, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan in early 2013.

Through these experiences I discovered that I would much rather stay in one place for a while rather than move around a lot, unlike many ["location-independent" minimalists](#minimalism). After carefully weighing my options I decided to move to Taiwan in May 2013 to get a feel for the expatriate lifestyle, blurring the lines between travelling and simply living overseas. After getting to know Taiwan's capital, Taipei, I went on [a 27 day bicycle trip around the entire island](http://synapticism.com/series/taiwan-bicycle-tour-2013/), outracing typhoons, exploring industrial ruins, getting in touch with local culture, and testing my personal limits.

Read about some of my travels on my blog:

- [A 27 day bicycle trip around Taiwan](http://synapticism.com/series/taiwan-bicycle-tour-2013/).
- [One week in Seoul](http://synapticism.com/series/south-korea-2012/).
- [Five days in Hong Kong](http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/).

Here are some of the places I have been in the last few years:

- 2014: still in Taiwan, another week in Hong Kong.
- 2013: three weeks in Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, and Melaka, Malaysia; a few days in Singapore; all around Taiwan in eight months; and a week in Okinawa, Japan.
- 2012: a week in Hong Kong; two months in Thailand; a week in Seoul, South Korea.



## <a name="photography"></a>Photography

[My photography](/photography) primarily focuses on dreamlike landscapes, abandoned places, and the intersection of the natural and artificial forces that shape our world. I am diligent about [geotagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging) my work and releasing it all under a Creative Commons license as a way of contributing to [free culture](#free). I also maintain a library of [free Lightroom presets on Github](https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets). [Read this overview of my photography](/photography) or check out [my newest work on Flickr](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/synapticism/).



## <a name="minimalism"></a>Minimalism

I am a minimalist and a digital nomad. I own very little and derive value from experiences rather than material wealth. I am location-independent, meaning that I can live and work pretty much anywhere, but I prefer to stay in one place for a while.

I was inspired to follow this lifestyle by the likes of [Leo](http://mnmlist.com/) [Baubuta](http://zenhabits.net/), [Tim Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/), [Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/), whose books and blogs I encountered in the late 2000s. The movement, if there ever was one, seem sto have broken apart shortly after formation, and I have been working with the lessons learned to forge my own individual path, a form of minimalism that works for me.



## <a name="education"></a>Education

I earned a Bachelor of Science with honours from the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/), Woodsworth College, 2007-2011. I double-majored in two split programs, making my degree quite the tongue-twister: [ecology/evolutionary biology](http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/) and [physical/environmental geography](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/futurestudents/academics/progs/geography). I was on the Dean's List every year and won numerous scholarships and awards including the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award in 2009. I worked on two major research projects in the [paleoclimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology) laboratory and learned how scientists reconstruct past environments from biological proxy data, primarily pollen and peat cores.



## <a name="free"></a>Free culture

I am devoted to free culture, open source software, and the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org). Almost all of [my photography](/photography) is released under Creative Commons licenses, as are all of the releases on [my netlabels](/music).

In the mid-2000s my thinking was highly influenced by [Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc/) and [Remix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book)) by [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/), [The Long Tail](http://www.longtail.com/) and [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free:_The_Future_of_a_Radical_Price) by [Chris Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer)), [Better Than Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php) by [Kevin Kelly](http://kk.org/), and various articles by [Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/). I decided to put what I had learned into practice by blogging about free music. Eventually this blog became quite a success, a story chronicled in [a beginner's guide to Ektoplazm](http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/).
