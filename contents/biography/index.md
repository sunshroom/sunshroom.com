I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology.

I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate domains.
