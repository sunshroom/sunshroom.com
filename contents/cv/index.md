title: Curriculum Vitae

---

I have pursued a completely non-standard path through life and, as such, do not have a history that neatly fits within the confines of the traditional curriculum vitae.

I am passionate about the intersection of science, technology, and design.

Presently I am interested in working on Node-based projects.

## Experience

Ektoplazm<br/>
<small>Founder, 2000--present</small>

What began as my humble music blog turned into a full-time project sometime around 2009.


Epost<br/>
<small>UI Designer, 2000--2007</small>

Over the course of seven years at Epost I worked on a wide variety of user-facing projects. I was primarily responsible for designing and maintaining the front-end of the web site as well as the back-end user interface. In the early years this was accomplished with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, as we began to integrate the service into the web sites of major financial institutions, my focus turned to JSP and XSLT. Along the way I gained experience with SVN, change management, etc.
