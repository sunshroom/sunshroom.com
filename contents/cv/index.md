## Summary

I am an experienced front-end developer and graphic artist with more than a decade of practical experience and a commitment to lifelong learning. I am currently interested in Node and WordPress-based freelance and part-time development work. I have prepared this CV to provide a high-level overview of my skills and experience but highly recommend checking out the rest of [my web site](http://alexandersynaptic.com) and [my blog](http://synapticism.com) to get a more well-rounded impression of my character and capabilities.



## Technical skills

* HTML5, CSS3 (with Sass/SCSS), JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
* WordPress development: [theme](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell) and [plugin](https://github.com/synapticism/ubik) authoring, [configuration](https://github.com/synapticism/wp-config-x), performance tuning, and search engine optimization.
* [Nginx configuration](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config) and optimization; a pinch of Apache as needed.
* [Gulp](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell/blob/master/gulpfile.js) and Grunt-based build processes.
* Content management, online promotion, copywriting, social media, and that sort of thing. I know how to get things done.
* Graphic design in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom.
* Scientific research, statistics, mapping, and so on.
* Node.js and Angular (learning).



## Open source projects

* [Pendrell](https://github.com/synapticism/pendrell): a minimal yet powerful WordPress theme for content-rich blogs.

* [alexandersynaptic.com](https://github.com/synapticism/alexandersynaptic.com): my GitHub Pages-based homepage made with Wintersmith (a Node-based static site generator), Jade, Stylus, Markdown, and various jQuery plugins.
* [wp-config-x](https://github.com/synapticism/wp-config-x): a WordPress configuration file starter kit.
* [nginx-config](https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config): a modular library of Nginx web server configuration files.
* [Synaptic Lightroom Presets](https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets): a library of Adobe Lightroom presets for use in digital photography post-processing.



## Professional experience

### Founder, Ektoplazm (2007--present)

Ektoplazm is a community-supported niche market music portal based on WordPress and served with Nginx. Currently I am working on a major redesign effort, updating the old design (originally made in 2007) to modern quality standards. As such, I do not recommend looking at the source to gauge my skill level, not until the redesign goes live anyhow! What is worth noting is the relative success of the project: 1 million annual visitors, more than 100,000 fans on Facebook, and something on the order of 100 million tracks downloaded.

My responsibilities behind the scenes are very diverse and perhaps too numerous to list. I am the content manager, curator, copywriter, and publisher in one; systems administrator; social media manager and community moderator; administrative coordinator (working with literally thousands of labels and artists); and, of course, technical support and customer service representative.

### UI Designer, epost/Innovapost (2000--2007)

In seven years of employment at epost/Innovapost my responsibilities continually evolved. Initially I was brought on board to interface between the marketing and development teams to manage the front-end web site (mostly static HTML/CSS with a bit of JavaScript) but soon became involved in back-end user interface design. Eventually my role shifted toward integrating the existing bill presentment service with financial institution web sites by converting legacy code to JSP/XSL for use with the Apache Struts framework.

None of these technologies are especially relevant today but my experience working with many different teams all across the organization remains valuable.



## Formal education

Bachelor of Science, University of Toronto, Woodsworth College, ecology and evolutionary biology/physical and environmental geography.
