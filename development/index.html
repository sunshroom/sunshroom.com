            <article>
              <section class="content"><p>I have been developing web sites since the late 1990s but only recently got serious about programming. Nowadays I am learning JavaScript, Node, and Angular with the goal of becoming a full stack&nbsp;developer.</p>
<p>Prior to this I worked as a front-end developer and user interface designer from 1999 to 2007. I mainly worked with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, CSS, and various templating languages and seldom made any forays into server-side&nbsp;programming.</p>
<p>In the middle of the noughties I discovered WordPress and began to teach myself <span class="caps">PHP</span> and MySQL on my own time. With my newfound skills I built a niche market music distribution platform, described below. I left the corporate world for higher education but continued to work on my own projects, learning new skills as I went along, particularly when scaling my web site with&nbsp;Nginx.</p>
<p>After graduating from university in 2011 my interst in web technology was rekindled and I began the long process of updating my skills and workflow for the new&nbsp;decade.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Here are several projects I have worked on over the course of the last few&nbsp;years.</p>
<h3>Ektoplazm</h3>
<p>My most notable achievement is building a niche market music distribution platform, <a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/">Ektoplazm</a>, which became very popular in the subculture it serves. Since 2007 more than 10 million full releases have been downloaded—approximately 50 million tracks in all, a number on par with industry giants like Bandcamp. This was accomplished on a shoestring budget without any advertising dollars. The full story is covered on my blog in <a href="http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/">a beginner&#39;s guide to Ektoplazm</a>.</p>
<p>These days I am deeply engaged in redeveloping the site after completing <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/ektoplazm-2012">a successful crowdfunding campaign</a> in the summer of&nbsp;2012.</p>
<h3>My&nbsp;homepage</h3>
<p><a href="http://alexandersynaptic.com/">This homepage</a> is an experiment in using Wintersmith, a Node-based static site generator, to create a simple personal homepage. The best way to learn is to give yourself a project—so I took it upon myself to learn how to work with Node, Jade, Stylus, Grunt, Bower, and GitHub pages by developing this web site. <a href="https://github.com/synapticism/alexandersynaptic.com">View the source on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Nginx configuration&nbsp;files</h3>
<p>While scaling Ektoplazm I switched from Apache to Nginx and went rather deep into configuration file hackery. <a href="https://github.com/synapticism/nginx-config">Here is my personal library</a> of configuration files used to manage multiple domains on Dreamhost with a special focus on serving large media&nbsp;objects.</p>

<h2>For&nbsp;hire</h2>
<p>I am open to Node and WordPress-based freelance work to supplement my income. Please <a href="/connect">contact me</a> to discuss the&nbsp;details.</p>
