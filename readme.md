# Jinshan

An experiment in using Wintersmith, a Node-based static site generator, to create a simple personal homepage.

## Setup

Most settings can be configured by editing ```config.json```. Projects should be included as directories containing an ```index.md``` file under ```/contents/projects/```.

### Backstretch

Drop any number of images into ```contents/img/backgrounds``` and tweak the relevant settings in ```config.json``` to control the background image slideshow.
