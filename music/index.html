              <section class="content"><p>I have been passionate about music for as long as I can remember. Over the years this has driven me to apply myself to various music-related projects. I never seem to get around to creating music myself—but I certainly facilitate its production and consumption through DJing, operating several record labes, and managing my <a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/">free music distribution portal</a>.</p>
<h2>DJing</h2>
<h3>Basilisk</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/profiles/basilisk">Basilisk</a> is my stage name in the psychedelic trance scene as well as the name that most people know me by. I pride myself on being a generalist, playing a wide range of different styles within the psytrance genre. My goal has always been to celebrate the diversity of psytrance rather than focus on one small piece of the puzzle. I also have a healthy respect for the timelessness of music and tend to take on the role of musical archaeologist by exploring the obscure depths of trance music history in my mixes and&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>Find Basilisk on <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/Basilisk/">Mixcloud</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DJ.Basilisk">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h3>Synaptic&nbsp;<span class="caps">FX</span></h3>
<p>Synaptic <span class="caps">FX</span> is the name I use for house and techno DJing. It is under this alias that I focus on more cutting edge trends in electronic music culture. My goal with this project is to express my love for futurism in music. In this way both my projects are evenly&nbsp;balanced.</p>

<h2>Record&nbsp;labels</h2>
<h3>Ektoplazm</h3>
<p>Ektoplazm is the name of my music distribution portal as well as my first netlabel. Founded in 2008, the Ektoplazm record label is chartered to promote unconventional talent with a professional approach to releasing free music in <span class="caps">MP3</span>, FLAC, and WAV format. The label has no defining sound; instead, it is dedicated to showcasing the range and diversity of the global psychedelic trance movement, always with an ear for quality. Altogether the label&#39;s releases have been downloaded more than 800,000 times as of November&nbsp;2013.</p>

<h3>Omnitropic</h3>
<p>Omnitropic is Ektoplazm&#39;s downtempo and ambient sublabel. Founded in 2009, this label is dedicated to releasing a wide range of high-quality downtempo, ambient, psychedelic dub, and experimental&nbsp;soundscapes.</p>

<h3>Drumlore</h3>
<p>Drumlore was originally founded in 2009 as an experiment in using free music to promote real-world events. Every release in the original Drumlore series was designed to promote a party featuring the artist on that same release. These releases were put out about a month in advance of each event, all of which were held in Toronto and generally well-attended. I also took a different approach with the album artwork in the original series; each piece was produced during a “one hour design&nbsp;challenge”.</p>
