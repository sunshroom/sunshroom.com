              <section class="content"><p><img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate&nbsp;domains.</p>
<h2><a name="entrepreneurship"></a>Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>I am currently bootstrapping my “accidental” startup in Taipei, Taiwan. During university <a href="/development">my music blog</a> became quite popular so I started a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was support to transform it into something more. There was! And now I am deeply engaged in realizing my vision of a forward-thinking independent music distribution platform. Moving to Taiwan is part of the plan—here I can be productive without burning through a lot of money. It is also an extraordinary adventure living the expat lifestyle in this beautiful foreign&nbsp;land!</p>
<h2><a name="travel"></a>Travel</h2>
<p>I have always dreamed of travelling the world but didn&#39;t act on that dream until after graduation in 2011. In 2012 I visited Asia for the first time, landing in Hong Kong for a brief stay before heading on to Thailand for two months and Seoul, South Korea, for a weeklong stopover on the way back home. I came back a changed man, restless with wanderlust, and soon set out for Asia once more, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan in early&nbsp;2013.</p>
<p>Through these experiences I found that I would much rather stay in one place for a while rather than move around a lot. After a careful consideration of the pros and cons I made a split decision in May 2013 and moved to Taiwan to try my hand at the expatriate lifestyle, blurring the lines between travelling somewhere and simply living there. After getting to know the capital, Taipei, I went on a 27 day bicycle trip around the entire island, outracing typhoons, exploring industrial ruins, and getting in touch with local&nbsp;culture.</p>
<p>Read about some of my travels on my&nbsp;blog:</p>

</ul>
<p>Here are some of the places I have been in the last couple of&nbsp;years:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013: Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, and Melaka, Malaysia; Singapore; all around Taiwan; and Okinawa,&nbsp;Japan.</li>
<li>2012: Hong Kong; Thailand; Seoul, South&nbsp;Korea.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="minimalism"></a>Minimalism</h2>
<p>I am a minimalist and a digital nomad. I own very little and derive value from experiences rather than material wealth. I am location-independent, meaning that I can live and work pretty much&nbsp;anywhere.</p>
<p>I was inspired to follow this lifestyle by the likes of <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">Leo</a> <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Baubuta</a>, <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a>, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">Chris Guillebeau</a>, whose books and blogs I encountered in the late&nbsp;2000s.</p>
<h2><a name="education"></a>Education</h2>
<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science with honours from the University of Toronto, Woodsworth College, 2007-2011. I double-majored in two split programs, making my degree quite the tongue-twister: ecology/evolutionary biology and physical/environmental geography. I was on the dean&#39;s list every year and won numerous scholarships and awards including the <span class="caps">NSERC</span> Undergraduate Student Research Award in 2009. I worked on two major research projects in the paleoclimate laboratory and got to know my way around the raw material scientists use to reconstruct past environments from biological proxy&nbsp;data.</p>
<h2><a name="free"></a>Free&nbsp;culture</h2>
<p>I am devoted to free culture, open source software, and the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Almost all of <a href="/photography">my photography</a> is released under Creative Commons licenses, as are all of the releases on <a href="/music">my netlabels</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s my thinking was highly influenced by <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book">Remix</a>) by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <a href="http://www.longtail.com/">The Long Tail</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free:_The_Future_of_a_Radical_Price">Free</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer">Chris Anderson</a>), <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php">Better Than Free</a> by <a href="http://kk.org/">Kevin Kelly</a>, and various articles by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>. I decided to put what I had learned into practise by blogging about free music. Eventually this blog became quite a success, a story chronicled in <a href="http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/">a beginner&#39;s guide to Ektoplazm</a>.</p>
