              <section class="content"><p><img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> I am <strong>Alexander Synaptic</strong>, a <a href="/design">designer</a>, <a href="/development">developer</a>, and <a href="/photography">photographer</a>, among other things. I also work with <a href="/music">music</a> as a <span class="caps">DJ</span>, record label owner, and distributor. I am currently bootstrapping <a href="/biography/#entrepreneurship">my “accidental” startup</a> in Taipei,&nbsp;Taiwan.</p>
<p>Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology. I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. My tendency is to dive deep with whatever I am doing, whether it is learning new skills or meeting new people. I know a lot about many different subjects and love to share what I have learned. I am a generalist, an integrative thinker, someone who connects the dots between disparate&nbsp;domains.</p>
<p>I love to <a href="/biography/#travel">travel</a>, particularly by bicycle, and follow a <a href="/biography/#minimalism">minimalist</a> lifestyle. I support <a href="/biography/#free">free culture</a>, open source software, and the Creative Commons. I studied evolutionary biology and physical geography in <a href="/biography/#education">university</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="entrepreneurship"></a>Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>I am currently bootstrapping my “accidental” startup in Taipei, Taiwan. During university <a href="/development">my music blog</a> became quite popular so I started a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was support to transform it into something more. There was! And now I am deeply engaged in realizing my vision of a forward-thinking independent music distribution platform. Moving to Taiwan is part of the plan—here I can be productive without burning through a lot of money. It is also an extraordinary adventure living the expat lifestyle in this beautiful foreign&nbsp;land!</p>
<h2><a name="travel"></a>Travel</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to the world but didn&#39;t act on that dream until <a href="/biography/#education">graduating from university</a> in 2011. In 2012 I visited Asia for the first time, landing in <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/">Hong Kong</a> for a brief visit before moving on to Thailand for two troubled months and <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/south-korea-2012/">one week in Seoul</a> on the way home. This trip changed me; I became restless with wanderlust and soon returned to Asia for another round, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan in early&nbsp;2013.</p>
<p>Through these experiences I discovered that I would much rather stay in one place for a while rather than move around a lot, unlike many <a href="/biography/#minimalism">“location-independent” minimalists</a>. After carefully weighing my options I decided to move to Taiwan in May 2013 to get a feel for the expatriate lifestyle, blurring the lines between travelling and simply living overseas. After getting to know Taiwan&#39;s capital, Taipei, I went on <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/taiwan-bicycle-tour-2013/">a 27 day bicycle trip around the entire island</a>, outracing typhoons, exploring industrial ruins, getting in touch with local culture, and testing my personal&nbsp;limits.</p>
<p>Read about some of my travels on my&nbsp;blog:</p>

<li><a href="http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/">Five days in Hong Kong</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the places I have been in the last couple of&nbsp;years:</p>
<ul>
<li>2014: Taiwan, Hong Kong&nbsp;(again).</li>
<li>2013: Sabah, Kuala Lumpur, and Melaka, Malaysia; Singapore; all around Taiwan; and Okinawa,&nbsp;Japan.</li>
<li>2012: Hong Kong; Thailand; Seoul, South&nbsp;Korea.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="photography"></a>Photography</h2>
<p><a href="/photography">My photography</a> primarily focuses on dreamlike landscapes, abandoned places, and the intersection of the natural and artificial forces that shape our world. I am diligent about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">geotagging</a> my work and releasing it all under a Creative Commons license as a way of contributing to <a href="/biography/#free">free culture</a>. I also maintain a library of <a href="https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets">free Lightroom presets on Github</a>. <a href="/photography">Read this overview of my photography</a> or check out <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/synapticism/">my newest work on Flickr</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="minimalism"></a>Minimalism</h2>
<p>I am a minimalist and a digital nomad. I own very little and derive value from experiences rather than material wealth. I am location-independent, meaning that I can live and work pretty much anywhere, but I prefer to stay in one place for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>I was inspired to follow this lifestyle by the likes of <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">Leo</a> <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Baubuta</a>, <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a>, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">Chris Guillebeau</a>, whose books and blogs I encountered in the late 2000s. The movement, if there ever was one, broke apart shortly after formation, and I have been working with the lessons learned to forge my own individual path, a form of minimalism that works for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h2><a name="education"></a>Education</h2>
<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science with honours from the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, Woodsworth College, 2007-2011. I double-majored in two split programs, making my degree quite the tongue-twister: <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/">ecology/evolutionary biology</a> and <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/futurestudents/academics/progs/geography">physical/environmental geography</a>. I was on the Dean&#39;s List every year and won numerous scholarships and awards including the <span class="caps">NSERC</span> Undergraduate Student Research Award in 2009. I worked on two major research projects in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology">paleoclimate</a> laboratory and learned how scientists reconstruct past environments from biological proxy data, primarily pollen and peat&nbsp;cores.</p>
<h2><a name="free"></a>Free&nbsp;culture</h2>
<p>I am devoted to free culture, open source software, and the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Almost all of <a href="/photography">my photography</a> is released under Creative Commons licenses, as are all of the releases on <a href="/music">my netlabels</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s my thinking was highly influenced by <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book">Remix</a>) by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <a href="http://www.longtail.com/">The Long Tail</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free:_The_Future_of_a_Radical_Price">Free</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer">Chris Anderson</a>), <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php">Better Than Free</a> by <a href="http://kk.org/">Kevin Kelly</a>, and various articles by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>. I decided to put what I had learned into practice by blogging about free music. Eventually this blog became quite a success, a story chronicled in <a href="http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/">a beginner&#39;s guide to Ektoplazm</a>.</p>
