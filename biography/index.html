              <section class="content"><p><img src="synaptic-forward-thinking.jpg" class="alignright marginleft" title="Forward thinking." alt="Forward thinking." /> I am <strong>Alexander Synaptic</strong>, a <a href="/design">designer</a>, <a href="/development">developer</a>, and <a href="/photography">photographer</a>, among other things. I also work with <a href="/music">music</a> as a <span class="caps">DJ</span>, record label owner, and distributor. I am currently bootstrapping <a href="/biography/#entrepreneurship">my “accidental” startup</a> in Tainan, Taiwan, as well as continuing my work on various creative projects, most of which are shared freely through <a href="http://synapticism.com/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Like many children of the 1980s I have an eclectic range of interests and experiences. I have applied myself to many different domains, from the creative arts to science and technology. I possess a fierce intellect and live for culture, conversation, and adventure. With my broad range of skills and interests I am passionate about connecting disparate domains of human activity to reveal surprising symmetries and synchronicities, hence the “synaptic” aspect of my self-created&nbsp;identity.</p>
<p>I follow a <a href="/biography/#minimalism">minimalist</a> lifestyle and love to <a href="/biography/#travel">travel</a>. I am an avid cyclist and urban explorer. I support <a href="/biography/#free">free culture</a>, open source software, and the Creative Commons. I studied evolutionary biology and physical geography in <a href="/biography/#education">university</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-entrepreneurship-a-entrepreneurship"><a name="entrepreneurship"></a>Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>I am currently bootstrapping my “accidental” startup in Taipei, Taiwan. During university <a href="/development">my music blog</a> became quite popular so I started a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was support to transform it into something more. There was! And now I am deeply engaged in realizing my vision of a forward-thinking independent music distribution platform. Moving to Taiwan is part of the plan—here I can be productive without burning through a lot of money. It is also an extraordinary adventure living the expat lifestyle in this beautiful foreign&nbsp;land.</p>
<p>I am currently bootstrapping my “accidental” startup in [place]Taiwan[/place]. My startup, if you can call it that, is an outgrowth of the niche market <a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/">free music portal</a> I founded many years ago, a story chronicled in <a href="http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/">a beginner’s guide to Ektoplazm</a>. This project grew to encompass most of my free time in my final year of <a href="/biography/#education">university</a> years which left me with a stark choice after graduation: find some way to transform the site into a real business or shut it down and get a “real” job. I went out on a limb and decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to see if there was community support for a massive overhaul of the site. There was, and so I embarked upon a long and rocky road to completely redeveloping this web site into something truly&nbsp;next-level.</p>
<p>Of course, things are never that easy in the startup world. I moved to [place]Vancouver[/place] to partner up with a technical co-founder but everything quickly fell apart. With no other viable option I decided to <a href="http://synapticism.com/flying-solo/">fly solo</a> and move to Asia to lower my cost of living and focus on the project. I’m still here more than a year later—and still working hard on realizing the vision that has been taking shape in my mind all these&nbsp;years.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-travel-a-travel"><a name="travel"></a>Travel</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to the world but didn’t act on that dream until <a href="/biography/#education">graduating from university</a> in 2011. In 2012 <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/hong-kong-2012/">I visited Asia for the first time</a>, landing in <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/hong-kong/">Hong Kong</a> for a brief visit before moving on to <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/thailand/">Thailand</a> for two troubled months and <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/south-korea-2012/">one week in Seoul</a> on the way home. This trip changed me; I became restless with wanderlust and soon returned to Asia for another round, visiting <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/malaysia/">Malaysia</a>, Singapore, and <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> in early 2013, ostensibly to research a place to live for the coming&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>After carefully weighing my options I decided to move to <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> in May 2013 to get a feel for the expatriate lifestyle, blurring the lines between travel and simply living overseas. After getting to know Taiwan’s capital, <a href="http://synapticism.com/places/taiwan/taipei/">Taipei</a>, I went on <a href="http://synapticism.com/series/taiwan-bicycle-tour-2013/">a 27 day bicycle trip around the entire island</a>, outracing typhoons, exploring industrial ruins, getting in touch with local culture, and testing my personal limits. More recently, in April 2014, I moved to Tainan to deepen my experience of living in Taiwan and to continue the&nbsp;work.</p>

<h2 id="-a-name-photography-a-photography"><a name="photography"></a>Photography</h2>
<p><a href="/photography">My photography</a> primarily focuses on dreamlike landscapes, abandoned places, and the intersection of the natural and artificial forces that shape our world. I am diligent about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">geotagging</a> my work and releasing it all under a Creative Commons license as a way of contributing to <a href="/biography/#free">free culture</a>. I also maintain a library of <a href="https://github.com/synapticism/synaptic-lightroom-presets">free Lightroom presets on Github</a>. <a href="/photography">Read this overview of my photography</a>, <a href="http://synapticimagery.com/">visit my professional portfolio site</a>, or check out <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/synapticism/">my newest work on Flickr</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-design-a-design"><a name="design"></a>Design</h2>
<p>I am a self-taught designer with more than 15 years of experience in the graphic arts. I use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom to make my dreams come alive. My source material is varied, including generated graphics, Creative Commons and public domain imagery, and <a href="/photography">my own photography</a>. <a href="/design">My design portfolio</a> is mainly filled with album artwork for the record labels I own or work with but I have also done corporate design work in the distant&nbsp;past.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-development-a-development"><a name="development"></a>Development</h2>
<p>I am a <a href="/development">front-end developer</a> with more than a decade of experience with many different technology stacks. I have worked mainly with <a href="http://synapticism.com/t/wordpress/">WordPress</a>, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, and MySQL, but in the last few years I have been branching out. I am fluent in <a href="http://synapticism.com/t/html5/"><span class="caps">HTML5</span></a> and employ Sass/<span class="caps">SCSS</span> in Gulp/Grunt build processes to generate CSS3. <a href="http://synapticism.com/t/nginx/">Nginx</a> is my web server of choice. Nowadays I am learning Node.js and advanced JavaScript, exploring Angular, and playing with Wintersmith, Jade, and Stylus. I also develop custom <a href="http://synapticism.com/t/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom</a> presets. You can <a href="http://www.github.com/synapticism">find me on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-minimalism-a-minimalism"><a name="minimalism"></a>Minimalism</h2>
<p>I am a minimalist and a digital nomad. I own very little and derive value from experiences rather than material wealth. I am location-independent, meaning that I can live and work pretty much anywhere, though I prefer to stay in one place for a while. It is both liberating and extremely challenging at times, for I am almost completely on my own most of the time, but I have become a much stronger, more well-rounded person by stepping far outside my cultural comfort&nbsp;zone.</p>
<p>I was inspired to follow this lifestyle by the likes of <a href="http://mnmlist.com/">Leo</a> <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Baubuta</a>, <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferriss</a>, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">Chris Guillebeau</a>, whose books and blogs I encountered in the late 2000s. There were others, too, but many of them revealed themselves to be charlatans and snake oil salesman. The movement, if there ever truly was one, seems to have broken apart shortly after formation, and I have been working with the lessons I have learned to forge my own individual path, a form of minimalism that works for me. I haven’t written much about my experiences, though I might one&nbsp;day.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-education-a-education"><a name="education"></a>Education</h2>
<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science with honours from the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, Woodsworth College, 2007-2011. I double-majored in two split programs, making my degree quite the tongue-twister: <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/">ecology/evolutionary biology</a> and <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/futurestudents/academics/progs/geography">physical/environmental geography</a>. I was on the Dean’s List every year and won numerous scholarships and awards including the <span class="caps">NSERC</span> Undergraduate Student Research Award in 2009. I worked on two major research projects in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology">paleoclimate</a> laboratory and learned how scientists reconstruct past environments from biological proxy data, primarily pollen and peat&nbsp;cores.</p>
<p>Working through a hard science degree at one of North America’s most prestigious research universities really wore me out—-especially since I was mainly studying various aspects of climate change and global warming, a most depressing subject. Whether I return to academia or not is unknown at this point—but I am grateful for the experiences I had and feel like a much more well-rounded and capable individual, having learned critical thinking and research skills in such a high-pressure&nbsp;environment.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-free-a-free-culture"><a name="free"></a>Free&nbsp;culture</h2>
<p>I am devoted to free culture, open source software, and the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Almost all of <a href="/photography">my photography</a> is released under Creative Commons licenses, as are all of the releases on <a href="/music">my netlabels</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s my thinking was highly influenced by <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book">Remix</a>) by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <a href="http://www.longtail.com/">The Long Tail</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free:_The_Future_of_a_Radical_Price">Free</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer">Chris Anderson</a>), <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php">Better Than Free</a> by <a href="http://kk.org/">Kevin Kelly</a>, and various articles by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>. I decided to put what I had learned into practice by blogging about free music. Eventually this blog became quite a success, a story chronicled in <a href="http://synapticism.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ektoplazm/">a beginner’s guide to Ektoplazm</a>.</p>
